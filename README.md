# Simple IDE for Android  

Lightweight Android IDE. Originally created for web development, later redesigned for Android apps. **After a long development journey, this project is now open-sourced to preserve the work.**

## Key Features

  (Unused compiler class may enable Kotlin support)
- **XML Layouts**: UI design via XML  
- **Custom Build System**:  
  - Faster than Gradle, fewer features
- **Library Management**:  
  - Manual library downloads  
  - Pre-installed libraries in templates 
- **Code Formatting**: Java, XML, JSON
